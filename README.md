## Recurse Center

For those who wish to apply or do not know about the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) check their website to find out more.

>Our philosophy. We believe people learn best when they take control of their own education and are free to 
explore what they’re interested in. RC is heavily influenced by unschooling.

>In the RC community you’ll find people like you. Recursers range in age from their teens to their 60s, although 
most are in their 20s or 30s. Batches of RC are generally between 30-45% women. Recursers also have a broad range 
of programming experience, from a few months to many decades. Recursers have been teachers, artists, professional 
athletes, doctors, hairdressers, scientists, poker players, project managers, lawyers, students, full-time parents, 
and many other things besides professional programmers. People also come to RC from all over the world. We’ve had 
Recursers travel to New York for their batch from more than 50 countries. Since we've been running online, people 
from over 12 different countries have done a batch of Virtual RC so far.
